4. Restart your computer.

### For "firefox" folder.
1. Find your current firefox profile by going to ``about:profiles`` in the browser. Find the default profile root directory and go there in a file manager. It will generally be in ``~/.mozilla/firefox/[yourprofilename]``
2. From the ``firefox`` folder, drag the ``chrome`` and ``user.js`` folders into your profile directory.
3. Restart Firefox.

You will also need ![sideberry](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery) if you want your tabs to be on a sidebar instead of on the top.
